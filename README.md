The correspondence of Cardinal Richelieu was last compiled in the 19th century by M. Avenel (Paris: Imprimerie Impériale, 1853–1877). That collection is acknowledged to be incomplete and biased by historians and Richelieu biographers; underrepresented are letters held outside of France and letters from aristocratic women whose influence over events might not be fully understood. To remedy this, I have identified and photographed letters to and from Richelieu not included in the Avenel compilation at archives in France, the UK, and the US; most of these letters are in manuscript, some in early modern print. Facsimiles and TEI-encoded transcriptions of the letters are here. The XML is being converted into a digital archive on California Digital Library's XTF program platform. Once we have permanent hosting the website address will be available here.
