The correspondence of Cardinal Richelieu was last compiled in the 19th century. That collection is acknowledged as incomplete and biased; underrepresented are letters held outside of France and letters from aristocratic women whose influence over events might not be fully understood. To remedy this, I've identified and photographed letters to and from Richelieu not included in the Avenel compilation at archives in France, the UK, and the US; most of these letters are in manuscript, some in early modern print. Facsimiles and TEI-encoded transcriptions of the letters are here. The XML is being converted into a digital archive on California Digital Library's XTF program platform. Once we have permanent hosting the website address will be available here.
