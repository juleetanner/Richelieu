The correspondence of Cardinal Richelieu was last compiled in the 19th century. That collection is acknowledged as incomplete and biased; underrepresented are letters held outside of France and letters from aristocratic women whose influence over events might not be fully understood. To remedy this, I have visited archives in Europe and the US to identify and photograph correspondence to and from Richelieu that was not included in the Avenel compilation. I have begun to transcribe and TEI-encode those letters here. The XML is being converted into a digital archive on California Digital Library's XTF program platform.
